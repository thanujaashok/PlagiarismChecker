# Plagiarism Checker


This project aims to develop a sophisticated Plagiarism Detection Tool designed to accurately assess the similarity index between two documents in response to the escalating challenge of plagiarism. Specifically tailored for research articles, code snippets, and similar texts, the tool provides a quantitative measure of similarity, enabling users to identify potential instances of plagiarism. 


## Features

- Enables user-friendly input through direct text pasting or convenient file uploads.
- B+ tree-based tokenized document storage with logarithmic search time complexity.
- Case-insensitive comparisons for comprehensive functionality.
- Displays and stores the percentage of similarity between two documents and relevant user information in a secure database
- Secured front-end


## Technology Stack:

- Python Programming Language:
The core language driving the backend logic and functionality of the application.
- Front-end Technologies:
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript used to craft a responsive and user-friendly interface for the web application.
- MongoDB (NoSQL Database):
Serves as the database for the application, providing user authentication for secure access and interaction.
- Flask:
Utilized for web application development, providing a robust framework and session management.
- B+ Tree Implementation:
Implemented for efficient data storage and retrieval
